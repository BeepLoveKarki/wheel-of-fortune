# Wheel Of Fortune

A purely C language using graphics of C language to depict a simple casino wheel of fortune demo!!! In this game, a player bets on a number
between 1 to 18 with a initial amount of bet set!!! The user wins, i.e. doubles in bet amount if the dice on the wheel stops on the number
choosen by him, else loses, i.e. his amount gets halved!!! Making his amount below $1 makes him lose the game!!!
